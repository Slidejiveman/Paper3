## DisCoCat uses functors to mp diagrams from the rigid category of pregroup grammars
## to vector space semantics.

## Pregroup grammar I -> T
# noun == n
# adj == nn.l
# transitive verb == n.rsn.l
# adjoints are considered the left and right inverses of a type.
# words are concatenated using the monoidal product and linked using cups.
# a single uncontracted s wire means the sentence is grammatically sound.
# the monoidal unit I is defined as Ty()
from discopy.grammar.pregroup import Cap, Cup, Id, Ty, Word
from lambeq import pregroups

n, s = Ty('n'), Ty('s')
words = [
    Word('she', n),
    Word('goes', n.r @ s @ n.l),
    Word('home', n)
]
cups = Cup(n, n.r) @ Id(s) @ Cup(n.l, n)
# * is 'unpacking' a list or a tuple in this sense (https://geekflare.com/python-unpacking-operators/) 
# ** is used to unpack dictionaries
assert Id().tensor(*words) == words[0] @ words[1] @ words[2] 
assert Ty().tensor(*[n.r, s, n.l]) == n.r @ s @ n.l
diagram = Id().tensor(*words) >> cups
# pregroups.draw(diagram)

## Alternative pregroup diagram creation method using lambeq
from lambeq import create_pregroup_diagram
from discopy.grammar.pregroup import Ty
words = [Word('she', n), Word('goes', n.r @ s @ n.l), Word('home', n)] # lambeq method
morphisms = [(Cup, 0, 1), (Cup, 3, 4)]
diagram = create_pregroup_diagram(words, Ty('s'), morphisms)
# diagram.draw()
same_words = Word('she', n) @ Word('goes', n.r @ s @ n.l) @ Word('home', n) # discopy method
same_diagram = same_words.cup(0, 1).cup(1, 2) # another alternative using discopy
# same_diagram.draw()
# Implicit swap introduction by using .cup() on non-adjacent qubits
n, s, p = map(Ty, "nsp")
words = Word('A', n @ p) @ Word('V', n.r @ s @ n.l) @ Word('B', p.r @ n)
# words.cup(1, 5).cup(0, 1).cup(1, 2).draw()

## Note: only diagrams of form word @ ... @  word >> cups_and_swaps can be drawn using
##       lambeq.pregroups.draw(). Functors and normal forms typically mess this up.
##       In these cases, use monoidal.Diagram.draw() instead to avoid ValueError.
from discopy.drawing import Equation
from discopy import monoidal
from pytest import raises
# In the original diagram, words appear before the cups
# print('Before normal form:', ', '.join(map(str, diagram.boxes)))
diagram_nf = monoidal.Diagram.normal_form(diagram)
# print('After normal form:', ', '.join(map(str, diagram_nf.boxes)))
# Equation(diagram, diagram_nf, symbol='->').draw(figsize=(10, 4))
# In the normalised diagram, boxes are not in the right order anymore,
# so cannot be drawn using pregroups.draw()
with raises(ValueError):
    pregroups.draw(diagram_nf)

## Functors: structure preserving transformation between different monoidal categories
# monoidal structure of objects is preserved
# adjoints are preserved
# monoidal structure of morphisms is preserved
# compositional structure of morphisms is preserved
# In free monoidal categoryl, applying a functor to a diagram amounts to simply providing a mappint
# for each generating object and morphism.
# In DisCoPy, a functor is defined by passing mappings (dictionaries or functions) as arguments
# ob and ar to the Functor class.
# lambeq's pipeline is implemented entirely based on the concept of Functors
# lambeq.CCGParser -> pregroup diagram -> lambeq.Rewriter -> simpler pregroup diagram -> (next choose a or b)
# (a:lambeq.TensorAnsatz -> tensor diagram/network) OR (b:lambeq.CircuitAnsatz -> quantum circuit)

## Example 1: "Very" Functor
# This functor adds the word "very" before every adjective in a DiscoCat diagram.
# use pregroup.Functor since we are mapping from a pregroup.Diagram to another pregroup.Diagram
# "very" is typed as (n @ n.l) @ (n @ n.l).l = n @ n.l @ n.l.l @ n.l
from lambeq import BobcatParser
from discopy.grammar.pregroup import Diagram, Functor
parser = BobcatParser(verbose='suppress') 
# determiners have the same type as adjectives
# but shouldn't add 'very' behind them
determiners = ['a', 'the', 'my', 'his', 'her', 'their']
# type for an adjective (this is a good example for  me to reference for an h type)
adj = n @ n.l
very = Word('very', adj @ adj.l)
cups = Diagram.cups(adj.l, adj)

# Methods
def very_ob(ty):
    return ty

def very_ar(box):
    if box != very:
        if box.name not in determiners:
            if box.cod == adj:
                return very @ box >> Id(adj) @ cups
    return box

# procedure
very_functor = Functor(ob=very_ob, ar=very_ar)
diagram = parser.sentence2diagram('a big bad wolf')
new_diagram = very_functor(diagram)
# Equation(diagram, new_diagram, symbol='->').draw(figsize=(10, 4))

snake = Id(n) @ Cap(n.r, n) >> Cup(n, n.r) @ Id(n)

## Classical DisCoCat: Tensor networks (FVect)
# Compact Closed Category because A.l = A.r = A*
# Objects are defined with the Dim class and morphisms with the Box class.
# The concrete value of the tensor is pa ssed to the data attribute as an unshaped list.
# DisCoPy will reshape it later based on input and output dimensions.
# tensor.Tensor computes tensor contractions directly while tensor.Diagram waits on the eval() method

# NOTE: This is extremely helpful when you want to understand what is going on mathematically.
# print(Tensor.cups(Dim(3), Dim(3)).array)
# print(Tensor.swap(Dim(2), Dim(2)).array)
# To implement a functor from pregroup.Diagram to tensor.Tensor, use a tensor.Functor with

# Hilbert spaces as morphisms.
# Objects are generated with the quantum.circuit.Ob class and morphisms with quantum.gates.

# evaluate with tensor contraction via the "eval()" method or export to pytket using "to_tk()"
